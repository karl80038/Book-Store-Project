	From their opening paragraphs alone, 
	I'm willing to bet you're persuaded to check out one brand in 
	more detail over the other. It isn't just the language itself 
	that gives you a sense of their business -- it's the design, the 
	font, and the color.
	Ultimately, your company profile matters. 
	It can intrigue a new visitor to check out your 
	products or services in more detail, and nudge potential customers 
	into choosing your business over competitors.
